In this version of the application, the front-end has a login screen in which the user enters their name
and is brought to a screen where there are a few things. First, is a list of the available users which
is the other users that are currently on the websocket server. This dynamically updates as users join 
or leave the server. There is also a chat box as well as an input box for the the chats. Currently
the chat box is visible for everyone in the server and sending messages sends them to everyone. When
a message is sent, there is the name of the person as well as the timestamp visible. Currently, what is
being worked on is adding a validation for a unique input username, as well as changing the chat so that
when an available user is clicked on, a private chat between the two users is created.
