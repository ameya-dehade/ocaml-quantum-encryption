# ocaml-quantum-encryption
Quantum Encryption Chat Application for Functional Programming Final Project.

Implementation of a Rescript Chat App that uses the Kyber Algorithm for key exchange, and uses AES-GCM for subsequent message encryption. This repository has two parts:

1. **Encryption library** <br>
   a. Kyber.ml - Contains all the logic for the Kyber's Key Generation, Encryption and Decryption, along with implementations for the Polynomial and Polynomial Matrices that are used.<br>
   b. Chat_encryption.ml - Abstracts away the Kyber algorithm into an interface that can be used by the chat application without caring about the underlying key exchange algorithm or message encryption algorithm
2. **Application** <br>
   a. TODO<br>
   b. TODO

## Algorithm
### Overview of Kyber
1. **Lattice Construction and Polynomial Rings**: Kyber operates over polynomial rings modulo a prime q, leveraging structured lattices. Keys and messages are represented as elements in these rings, and operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) are performed modulo q and x^n+1, where n is a power of 2.
2. **Key Generation and Noise**: Security relies on the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem. During key generation, small random "noise" is added to polynomials to create public/private key pairs. The noise ensures that recovering the secret key from the public key remains computationally hard, even for quantum adversaries.
3. **Encryption and Decryption**: Encryption involves encoding the plaintext into a polynomial, performing polynomial multiplications with the public key, and adding noise for security. Decryption uses the private key to undo these operations and recover the plaintext while correcting for the introduced noise.

### Testing
1. Extensive test suite that checks all functions in the supporting Polynomial and Polynomial Matrix library, along with the Kyber and Chat Encryption logic.
2. ```Test Coverage: 243/258 (94.19%)```

### Instruction to run
1. Build project - dune build
2. Test project - dune test

## Usage in Chat App - Painful!
Since there was no way to directly use this OCaml library in the Rescript Application, we had to use the command:<br>
```cat myfile.ml | npx rescript format -stdin .ml > myfile.res```<br>
to convert the .ml to .res.<br>
HOWEVER, many library we used (like Core and CryptoKit) had no Rescript support, so we had to replace them with alternative that had very different syntax. This meant that we had rework a significant chunk of the converted .res files to use appropriate libraries. Chat_encryption.res had to be written completely from scratch.
